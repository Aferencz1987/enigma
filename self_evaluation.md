SELF EVALUATION

Functionality
I definitely meet expectations on functionality. My methods all work and everything ask of in the requirements has been met.

OOP
I meet expectations on object oriented programming. I have classes that I need and don't have classes I don't.

Ruby convention/mechanics
I think I am slightly above meets expectations. My methods are dynamic and can intake a variety of arguments. They are clean and easy to follow.

TDD
I would definitely say that I meet expectations. While there are not a lot of tests overall, each test has pieces that check the inner workings of the methods. I made all of my tests first and then updated both the tests to be more specific and the methods to reflect the outcomes  I believe that all of the components that can change are tested
